"""Shared look-ahead-safe date-window filtering for dated content.

News, StockTwits, and Reddit all pull recent items that must be trimmed to the
analysis window so a historical/backtest run never sees content published after
its as-of date. Centralizing the rule keeps every source consistent (#1126,
#1220): every timestamp is normalized to UTC, the upper bound is exclusive at
midnight after ``end`` (so an item stamped exactly then can't leak), and an
undated item is kept only when the window reaches the present (a live run), since
in a backtest we can't prove it isn't future.
